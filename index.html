      <h4>Intro</h4>
      <p>
       Being a parent is the hardest job on this planet.
       Not only do you need exceptional multitasking skills, but you also need to be able to
       thrive in high pressure situations while maintaining a level of calm-headedness and empathy.
       A great example of this would be mornings with a three year old: there is breakfast to make,
       clothes to put on, infants to wake up, and coffee to make and forget. There is a plethora of
       tasks to complete within a short amount of time, all the while, priorities and deadlines shift on a moments notice.
       This attention to detail, organization, and task management is why I would be a perfect addition to your team.

                We can all  agree that the last two and a half years has been stressful, scary, and full of change.
                When the pandemic originally hit in March of 2020, I was working full-time as a Chiropractor and was an essential
                employee, due to the nature of my healthcare-orientated field. At the time, I had a one year old toddler and my co-parent
                was pregnant with our second child. Because of the risk to my immediate family unit, I made the difficult decision to leave
                healthcare and became a full-time homemaker.
